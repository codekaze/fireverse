# Fireverse

[![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/firedart.svg)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/fireverse)

This package is made to use firebase for all Platforms.

As we know, currently the official packages for firebase do not yet support the windows-desktop version.

That's the reason, I made this package.

Basically, this package is a combination of FireDart and the official Firebase library.
